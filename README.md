> ### :warning: Important :warning:
> 
> It is very important that you use the specific release manifest url, and not the `/latest` url here. For more details about why this is important and how Foundry Installs/Updates packages, read [this wiki article](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/releases-and-history).

Clicking "Save" in the bottom right will save the new version, which means that anyone installing your module from within Foundry will get that version, and a post will be generated in the #release-announcements channel on the official Foundry VTT Discord.
